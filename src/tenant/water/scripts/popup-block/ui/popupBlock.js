/**
 * Putting the assistant out of use while a sub-form popup is open.
 *
 * Posse blocks the form behind a popup, but the assistant floating on top of it is
 * not part of that form and stays live - so a user can click a guided question, open
 * the menu, or type a message about fields that are frozen underneath them. Worse,
 * the assistant can offer to fill in a form it cannot currently touch.
 *
 * Blocking is visible rather than silent. A control that looks normal and does
 * nothing reads as broken; one that is plainly out of use for a stated reason reads
 * as waiting.
