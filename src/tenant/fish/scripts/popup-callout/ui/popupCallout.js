/**
 * The banner a popup shows to say the conversation carries over.
 *

 * with no visible sign that it is the same conversation. The history is in fact
 * intact - the thread ID rides across in sessionStorage - so this is a banner about
 * something already true, not a feature that moves data.
 *
 * It also offers to enlarge the window, because the form opens these around 700px
 * wide and a 420px assistant beside a sub-form is a tight fit.
 */

/**
 * Set when the user dismisses the banner, so it stays gone.
 *
 * It records a decision rather than an appearance. Selecting a field in a Posse
 * sub-form posts the page back and rebuilds the widget from scratch, several times
 * over in a short form - showing the banner only on the first of those meant it
 * vanished a moment after the user arrived, for no reason they could see. It now
 * stays until they close it.
 *
 * sessionStorage is the right store twice over: a popup inherits its opener's copy at
 * creation, and the main form never shows this banner, so the key can only have been
 * written by this popup itself - which is what makes the dismissal survive the
 * popup's own postbacks without following the user into the next popup they open.
